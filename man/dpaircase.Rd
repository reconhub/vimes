\arguments{
\item{p}{A \code{numeric} vector providing the probability mass function, or
empirical frequencies, of pairwise distances.}

\item{pi}{The reporting probability, i.e. the proportion of cases of the
outbreak that have been reported.}

\item{alpha}{The probability threshold to be used to determine the maximum
value of generations between two successive cases to consider;
this value ('max_kappa') will be the smallest k so that
p(k > max_kappa) < alpha. Defaults to 0.001.}

\item{x}{vector of quantiles.}

\item{gamma_shape}{shape of the gamma distribution used for the serial interval}

\item{gamma_rate}{an alternative way to specify the scale of the gamma
distribution used for the serial interval}

\item{gamma_scale}{scale of the gamma distribution used for the serial interval}

\item{poisson_rate}{rate (i.e. mean) of the poisson distribution used for the
per time unit genetic mutation rate}

\item{type}{type of distance to be considered (one of "temporal","genetic",
"spatial" or "empiric").}

\item{sd_spatial}{standard deviation of the Normal spatial kernel.}

\item{sd}{standard deviation of the Normal spatial kernel.}

\item{shape}{shape of the gamma distribution used for the serial interval}

\item{rate}{an alternative way to specify the scale of the gamma distribution
used for the serial interval}

\item{scale}{scale of the gamma distribution used for the serial interval}

\description{
These functions compute the expected distributions of distances between pairs
of cases given a case reporting probability 'pi'. Analytical results are used
for some special cases, including:
}
\details{
\itemize{

\item temporal distances: the serial interval is assumed to be
gamma-distributed; the procedure returns a discretized, weighted convolution
of gamma distributions.

\item genetic distances: assumed ... TBC

## COMPARE DEMPIRIC AND DTEMPORAL

## Note in this comparison we are not expecting to get exactly the same
## results since dempiric does the convolution between discretised gamma
## distributions whilst dtemporal does the convolution between gamma
## distributions.

## compute empirical distribution correponding to exponential(mean 50)

mean_exp <- 50
x <- 0:300
reporting_rate <- 0.5
p <- dgamma(x, shape = mean_exp, rate = 1)

## computes pdf of a gamma distr with shape mean_exp and scale = rate = 1
## (i.e. an exponential distr with mean mean_exp)

## use this as an empirical distribution to feed into dempiric

empiric_exp_distr_r50 <- dpaircase(x, type = "empiric",
                                   p = p,
                                   pi = reporting_rate)
temporal_distr_r50 <- dpaircase(x, type = "temporal",
                                gamma_shape = mean_exp,
                                gamma_rate = 1,
                                pi = reporting_rate)

## compare the two

correlation <- cor(empiric_exp_distr_r50,

## COMPARE DEMPIRIC AND DGENETIC

## compute empirical distribution correponding to

prob <- 1-mutation_rate/(mutation_rate+1)


## pmf of a negative binomial distr with parameters size and prob

p <- dnbinom(x, size = mean_exp,prob = prob)


## use this as an empirical distribution to feed into dempiric

empiric_exp_distr_r50 <- dpaircase(x, type = "empiric",
